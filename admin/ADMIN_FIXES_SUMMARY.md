# EYGII Admin Panel - Debug & Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Navigation Path Issues
**Problem**: The sidebar navigation had inconsistent paths that didn't account for whether the user was in the admin root directory or the pages subdirectory, causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `admin/includes/sidebar.php` with dynamic path detection
- Added logic to determine current directory context
- Implemented proper relative paths for both dashboard and pages directories

```php
// Determine if we're in the admin root or pages subdirectory
$is_in_pages = ($current_dir === 'pages');
$base_path = $is_in_pages ? '../' : '';
$pages_path = $is_in_pages ? '' : 'pages/';
```

### 2. Header File Path Issues
**Problem**: The header file had hardcoded paths that didn't work from different directory contexts.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `admin/includes/header.php`
- Added dynamic path detection at the top of the file
- Fixed all navigation links in the top navbar dropdown
- Removed broken logo reference

### 3. Missing API Endpoints
**Problem**: Several export functionality endpoints were missing, causing JavaScript errors.

**Solution**: Created missing API files:
- `admin/api/export_contacts.php` - CSV export for contact messages
- `admin/api/export_subscribers.php` - CSV export for newsletter subscribers  
- `admin/api/export_volunteers.php` - CSV export for volunteer applications

### 4. Removed Non-Existent Pages
**Problem**: Sidebar contained links to pages that don't exist, causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: Cleaned up sidebar navigation to only include existing pages:
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Programs
- ✅ News & Blog
- ✅ Contact Messages
- ✅ Volunteers
- ✅ Newsletter
- ✅ Settings
- ❌ Removed: Events, Gallery, Analytics, Reports, Admin Users, Backup & Restore, Donations

### 5. Missing Upload Directories
**Problem**: Image upload functionality would fail due to missing directories.

**Solution**: Created required directories:
- `assets/images/programs/` - For program images
- `assets/images/news/` - For news article images
